1. ADD DELTA SUPPORT IN ALL UPDATE FUNCTIONS
2. Actually pause entirely when tab becomes inactive (float text saying press enter to resume)
3. Make each tile switch tileset image at a random interval between 1 - 100 upon forme change?
4. loop music

5. In pacman rooms, get rid of artifacts, and make central room following them have a door that needs 4 more artifacts. Room has 4 doors at top that lead to 4 seperate challenge paths (that interweave and loop around). Upon unlocking central door, lead to room that has the UPGRADE of the game that let's you manually switch glitches of the room, which leads to the GIANT FINAL CAVE (640 BY 480?) of the game. Switching glitches manually switches to a random glitch that is not currently selected. Make tiles of rooms randomly be drawn as different tilesets (although at low frequency). Every time you glitch the room, the frequency of misdrawn tiles, the frequency of player image glitching (sprite sheet and facing) increases.
Change glitchtransform to just conditionals in gamemover, so enemies 2
	-Giant cave makes use of doors going to nonreflective places and warping around (Essentially cave is a big maze)
